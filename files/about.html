        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
        <p class="aboutText">
          Born and raised in California, spent two years in Southern Utah, and now located in beautiful New York. I am a software engineer with a knack for solving problems with efficient solutions.<br><br> I currently work mainly with JavaScript and TypeScript, along with React, Redux, Node, and SQL and NoSQL databases, but I enjoy diving into new tech (or tech that may just be new to me!). Recently I've been improving my knowledge of Java to enhance my skill set.<br><br>As a software engineer, communicating clearly and building community with my team is extremely important to me. When I am working, I aspire to encourage those around me and vice versa.
        </p>
        <h3>Outside of Code</h3>
        <p class="aboutText">
          When I am not coding, I am an avid reader and I dabble in learning new languages. Currently, I have learned Spanish to an advanced level where I sometimes forget I haven't always known Spanish. I also study Portuguese, German, and Norwegian. What interests me the most about other languages are the origin of words and how cultures have come together to affect language.
          <br><br>
          I enjoy reading books that range from historical fiction to those that teach me new algorithms. When I am on the train, I always have a book in my hand and I am always open to book recommendations!
